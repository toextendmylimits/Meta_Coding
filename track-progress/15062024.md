| ------------------------| ------------------------------ 
| 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal | Very familiar
| 408. Valid Word Abbreviation | Very familiar
| 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses | Very familiar 
| 339. Nested List Weight Sum | Beware for BFS, enqueue the list, queue(nesteList) not queue([nestedList])
| 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III | Beware use parent not next
| 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors | Beware for binary search, target is nonzeroIdxValPairs[i][0], not i
| 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View | Beware if using stack, using while not if, while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]; Beware follow up of occean view from either sides https://leetcode.com/playground/JM6Vaawr
| 528. Random Pick with Weight | Practice again. Beware use self.prefixSum[-1] * random.random()
| 227. Basic Calculator II | Familiar, but better practice again
| 938. Range Sum of BST | Faimiliar, beware for BFS, pop the item, currNode = queue.popleft(), Don't use root directly!!!
| 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array | Familiar with both heap and quick select.
| 71. Simplify Path | Beware to append to the stack!!!

| 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree | Very faimilar
