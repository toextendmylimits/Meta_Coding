|1004. Max Consecutive Ones III | YES | NO | Very familiar. Quick look is enough
|987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree | NO | YES | Practice both BFS and DFS, beware add bracket for tuple, like deque([(root, 0, 0)]). Learn custom sort by the way, key=lambda, key=cmp_to_key(compareFunction)
