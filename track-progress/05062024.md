| Question                | Bug-free | Need practice again | Note                         
| ------------------------| ----------------------- |---------------------|------------------------------ 
|314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal | NO | YES | Column should increase 1 for right child; Process currNode's value, not root value when performing BFS
|408. Valid Word Abbreviation | NO | YES | When deciding the number, check whether it's digit: while j < len(abbr) and abbr[j].isdigit()
|339. Nested List Weight Sum | NO | YES | Beware for DFS, the function parameters are nestedList and depth, also practice class nestedInteger https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python/solution-flatten-nested-list-iterator
|1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses | NO | YES | Practice a few times or even memorize the code
|1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III | NO | YES | Memorize the code
|1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors| NO | YES | Memorize the code, three approachs: 1.array, two pointers 2. array, binary search 3. hash map
|680. Valid Palindrome II | NO | YES | Should expand to k mismatches as well 
|1216. Valid Palindrome III | NO | YES | Just memorize the code
|528. Random Pick with Weight| NO | YES | Beware target = self.prefixSum[-1] * random.random() and mid element should > target 
|1762. Buildings With an Ocean View | NO | YES | Two approaches: 1. Scan from right 2. Mono stack and scan from left Also practice have either side occean views for follow-up
|227. Basic Calculator II | NO | YES | Memorize two approaches: 1. Use stack 2. Use lastNum and currNum we use a variable lastNumber to track the value of the last evaluated expression. Check for explanation in the solution area.
|346. Moving Average from Data Stream | NO | YES | Just memorize the code which is relatively easy
|426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List | NO | YES | Memorize the two approcaches: 1. Recursive 2. Iterative using stack
|71. Simplify Path | NO | YES | beware the variant that has two parameters: current directory and path. Need to put directory part in stack first. https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-292627-1-1.html
