| Question                | Note                         
| ------------------------| ------------------------------ 
| 938. Range Sum of BST | Practice both recursive and iterative again, especially iterative one
| 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array | Master three approaches: sort, heap, and quick select
| 426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List | Master both recursive and iterative, dry run test case as well
| 71. Simplify Path | Beware variant that there is parent directory already, so pop all non-null parts into stack first
| 986 variant https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/883800/facebook-phone-merge-sorted-arrays-merge-two-sorted-interval-lists | Beware check condition: not result or, also dry run code
| 708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List | Too difficult, just memorize the three cases and code
| 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix | Need to review. Beware to return shortest path using backtrace
| 827. Making A Large Island | Difficult. Memorize main logic
| 973. K Closest Points to Origin | Not difficult, but seems not familiar, practice again
| 398. Random Pick Index | Memorize reservior sampling algorithm
| 636. Exclusive Time of Functions | Practice again
| 670. Maximum Swap | Practice again
| 199. Binary Tree Right Side View | Also practice DFS
| 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value | Difficult, memorize the code
| 56. Merge Intervals | Also memorize approach using heap
| 23. Merge k Sorted Lists | Beware edge case when start + 1 == end
| 31. Next Permutation | Practice again, beware how to find rightIdx
