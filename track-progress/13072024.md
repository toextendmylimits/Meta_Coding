| Question                | Note                         
| ------------------------| ------------------------------ 
| 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal | Very familiar, but beware use currNode not root!!!
| 408. Valid Word Abbreviation | Beware to check whether abbr[j] is digit when updating currNum, and walk through a test
| 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III | Beware to use parent not next!!! 
| 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses | Remember use add for set not append
| 339. Nested List Weight Sum | 
| 680. Valid Palindrome II | For dp, end is in range(start, len(s))
| 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View | Beware follow-up to check both sides https://leetcode.com/playground/JM6Vaawr
| 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors | Beware typo: total += (not total =), don't forget break while loop when finding target Index
| 528. Random Pick with Weight | Very familiar. Use random.random() * total to get the target number
| 227. Basic Calculator II | Familiar with stack and the other approach using constant space
| 938. Range Sum of BST | Practice both recursive and iterative again, especially iterative one
| 346. Moving Average from Data Stream | Beware to append val to the queue
| 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array | Master three approaches: sort, heap, and quick select
| 426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List | Master both recursive and iterative, dry run test case as well
| 71. Simplify Path | Beware variant that there is parent directory already, so pop all non-null parts into stack first
| 791. Custom Sort String | Very familiar
| 986. Interval List Intersections | Very familiar
| 708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List | Too difficult, just memorize the three cases and code
| 921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid | Familiar
| 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix | Need to review. Beware to return shortest path using backtrace
| 827. Making A Large Island | Difficult. Memorize main logic
| 973. K Closest Points to Origin | Not difficult, but seems not familiar, practice again
| 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree | Familiar
| 398. Random Pick Index | Memorize reservior sampling algorithm
| 560. Subarray Sum Equals K | Familiar
| 249. Group Shifted Strings | Familiar
| 162. Find Peak Element | Familiar
| 138. Copy List with Random Pointer | Beware edgecase null, and should practice not using map later
