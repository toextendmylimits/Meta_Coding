| ------------------------| ------------------------------ 
| 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal | Very familiar, but beware use currNode not root!!!
| 408. Valid Word Abbreviation | Beware to check whether abbr[j] is digit when updating currNum, and walk through a test
| 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III | Beware to use parent not next!!! 
| 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses | Remember use add for set not append
| 339. Nested List Weight Sum | 
| 680. Valid Palindrome II | For dp, end is in range(start, len(s))
| 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View | Beware follow-up to check both sides https://leetcode.com/playground/JM6Vaawr
| 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors | Beware typo: total += (not total =), don't forget break while loop when finding target Index
