2. Prepare answers for common meta behaviour questions
3. Go through the top 80 meta coding questions

# Major change on 23 Jul 2024

3. 27 July 2024 I should review both system design and coding questions

# Major change on 27 Jul 2024
Luckily my interviews were postponed to 6 Aug 2024, so I have more time to prepare. However, time is still limited, and I should aim to work on the remaining system design questions this weekend.
