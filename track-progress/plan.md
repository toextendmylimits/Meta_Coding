4. On 18 July 2024, I should have a look another 4 system design questions.

# Urgent change
On 19 July 2024, I still haven't finished preparation for system design, coding and behaviour questions. This is really terrible! What I should for today and the weekends:
1. Practice 10 common meta interview system design questions
2. Prepare answers for common meta behaviour questions
3. Go through the top 80 meta coding questions

# Major change on 23 Jul 2024
Given there are only 6 days before the Meta interviews, and I haven't practiced the common meta system design interview questions. In the following three days, I should really focus on system design questions, aiming to practice 10 questions.

# Last push on 25 Jul 2024
Time is really running out. In the remaining 4 days of this week, I should really focus on my preparation for Meta interviews. The detailed plan are as follows:
1. 25 July 2024 I should practice 10 system design questions
2. 26 July 2024 I should reveiew all these system design questions, and practice the remaining 30 or so coding questions
3. 27 July 2024 I should review both system design and coding questions

# Major change on 27 Jul 2024
Luckily my interviews were postponed to 6 Aug 2024, so I have more time to prepare. However, time is still limited, and I should aim to work on the remaining system design questions this weekend.
So the plan is:
1. Work on proximity service, local delivery like gopuff/uber eat, hotel booking service, youtube, search/typehead search complete
2. top k, facebook messager, chess game, leaderboard

I should also finish the remaining 30 frequent coding questions.
